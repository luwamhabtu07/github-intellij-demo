# Simple Geometry Application

This is a Java application that models geometric shapes using abstract classes and inheritance.
It calculates the area and perimeter for different shapes, including Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle.
The program demonstrates the use of abstract classes and method overriding in Java.

## Features
- Abstract `Shape` class with `calculateArea()` and `calculatePerimeter()`
- Three concrete subclasses: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`
- Calculates area and perimeter using mathematical formulas
- Supports dynamic shape creation
- Demonstrates **inheritance** and **method overriding**
